# Generic Jekyll Site With Bitwiser

This is a generic Jekyll Site that uses the [Bitwiser](https://github.com/brijeshb42/bitwiser) theme.  This site is designed for easy deployment to Heroku.

This site is created by a script that downloads the [Bitwiser](https://github.com/brijeshb42/bitwiser) source code and then adds the scripts and configuration files I created at (https://github.com/jhsu802701/jekyll-heroku)[https://github.com/jhsu802701/jekyll-heroku] to streamline the process of deploying to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
